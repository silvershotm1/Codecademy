// Partials are denoted with an _ before the file name;
// @import will import the partial into our css
// 4. Organizing with Partials
@import "helper/variables";

// 5. @Extend
.absolute {
   position: absolute
}
@extend .absolute;

// 6. %Placeholders  // absolute in placeholder file

%absolute {
  position: absolute;
}
@extend %absolute;

// 7. Extend Vs. Mixin
@extend %center; // in span and H1 tag

// 8. Generalizations:
//Sustainability is key in Sass, planning out the structure of your files
//and sticking to naming conventions for both variables, mixins, and selectors
//can reduce complexity.
